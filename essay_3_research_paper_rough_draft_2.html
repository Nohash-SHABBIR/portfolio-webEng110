      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Teaching kids in their first language is an important topic in schools, especially for those who speak one language at home and another at school. The articles <em>"Lost in Translation"</em> by Maya Alkateb-Chamis and <em>"The Evolution of Literacy Education"</em> both talk about how language affects learning. <em>"Lost in Translation"</em> explains that kids who don’t learn in their home language can struggle with reading and writing, but using their first language in school can help them do better. <em>"The Evolution of Literacy Education"</em> looks at how teaching reading and writing has changed over time, from ancient methods to today’s phonics systems. Both articles show how important language is for success, especially for children who grow up in multilingual homes, like Asian children living in the U.S.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some experts think teaching kids in their home language gives them a strong base for learning. Others believe teaching them only in the school language, like English, helps them adapt faster. This raises an important question: How does learning in a child’s first language improve their reading, writing, and school success? This essay will explore that question using research like Jim Cummins’ Threshold Hypothesis and other studies, while also looking at different views on the topic.
      </p>
      <h2>Context</h2>
      <p>
        The debate over using a child’s home language in school has been around for a long time. In the past, people taught reading and writing through memorizing and repeating words. Over time, methods like phonics have become more common because they work better. For kids who speak more than one language, learning in their first language can help connect what they know at home with what they learn at school. Jim Cummins’ Threshold Hypothesis says that being good at your first language makes it easier to learn a second one. This idea has led to programs that mix both home and school languages. At the same time, some schools still use immersion programs, where only English is spoken, because they think it helps kids learn English faster and fit in better.
      </p>
      <h2>Analysis and Discussion</h2>
      <p>
        In <em>"Lost in Translation"</em>, Maya Alkateb-Chamis explains that children who don’t use their first language in school often fall behind in reading and writing. She believes that learning in their home language can help them improve these skills. This idea is supported by Jim Cummins’ Threshold Hypothesis, which shows that when kids build strong skills in their first language, it helps them learn and do better in the second language too. Cummins also says that learning in their home language can make kids feel more confident and connected to their culture, which helps them stay engaged in school.
      </p>
      <p>
        Research by Wayne Thomas and Virginia Collier in <em>"School Effectiveness for Language Minority Students"</em> backs up this idea. They found that students in bilingual programs do better in school over time than those in English-only programs. These programs help kids learn both languages without falling behind. However, Rosalie Porter, in <em>"The Case Against Bilingual Education"</em>, argues that kids learn English faster when they are in immersion programs where only English is spoken. While her ideas focus on quick results, they don’t take into account the long-term benefits of bilingual education, like better academic performance and stronger reading skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        This shows that both approaches have pros and cons. Teaching kids in their first language helps with learning and confidence, but some believe focusing only on English can help them adapt to school more quickly. Understanding these ideas can help schools make better choices for children from multilingual backgrounds.

      <h2>Feedback</h2>
      <p>Hi Shabbir,</p>
      <p>Good preliminary progress so far on Essay 3. Here are some of my comments for revision:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Whenever you tell me the name of an article, you must remember to put it in quotation marks, and when you use the idea from an article, such as Cummins' theory, you should always be citing directly from the text and providing quotes.</li>
        <li>Your essay should develop your stand/position/opinion on your research question. Based on what you have read, do you think children should or should not be taught in their first language in school and why?</li>
        <li>Each section of this essay so far should be further developed and explained. Finding scholarly sources will help with expanding the length, detail, and scope of your paper. Your essay also neglects to mention a news article or an essay which was assigned in class which presents this language phenomenon, which is an essential aspect of the final grade of the essay.</li>
        <li>You seem to repeat some phrases a few times without explanation, and other phrases seem vague and unsubstantiated. Go through your final draft before submitting and determine where you can back up your own writing with more detailed explanations or quotes from the text.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Overall, you must keep in mind the criteria on the rubric which we discussed in class today as you complete your final paper.</p>
      <p>Best,<br>Amanda</p>
