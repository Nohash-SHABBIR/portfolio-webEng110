  <h1>Essay 1: Literacy Autobiography **FIRST DRAFT**</h1>
  <div class="container">
    <div class="content">
      Gloria Anzaldúa's essay "How to Tame a Wild Tongue" she shared about her culture difference, and also mixing her different language into one place and her feelings towards the people she was communicated.

      Anzaldúa is from Mexican culture, so her culture is related to them she likes movies, music. These references may sound unfamiliar to some readers who is from different background then her. They also represent the importance of Chicano culture where she came from originally.

      Anzaldúa also talked about how she feels by using two different languages while writing and speaking with others she always ended up mixing the languages. Even though she always tried to use English as her main languages all the time.

      In her essay she also expresses the feelings towards the English speakers who seems to be always judged her because of her different background and how she feels when using English as her main language instead of her own languages. She said she wishes to use Spanish as her main language everywhere without any issues that's because sometimes she feels that she doesn't belong where is is now. Even though she always uses her own languages while talking with her families and friends and tries to communicate with others with English.

      But most of all she is very proud about herself that who she is and she accepts the reality saying, “I will no longer be made to feel ashamed of existing. I will have my voice: Indian, Spanish, white. I will have my serpent's tongue - my woman's voice, my sexual voice, My poet's voice. I will overcome the tradition of silence.”

      By reading her essay I can also find some similar experience that I had when I first came to United States. I was totally from different background; I was not used to how people talk and communicate with each other. So, at first I was having a hard time to understand people and I always been judged by other people because of my different background but just like Gloria Anzaldúa she takes pride while using her own language and she wants to accept who she is while using her own language I also take pride while using my own language.

      Since I use two different languages all the time sometimes I mix-up my writing and communication skill in an odd way which is pretty similar to Gloria Anzaldua's experience. Whenever I speak with my parents, relatives or other family members I use my own language which is not English, but I use English whenever I'm on school or some other workplaces.

      So overall I think it's a common experience for people who came from different background to feel similar way how Gloria Anzaldúa felt. But instead of being ashamed they should take pride of their different culture just like Anzaldúa did in her essay.

      <h2>Shabbir Essay 1 Rough Draft Feedback</h2>
      <p>Hi Shabbir! Here are my suggestions for revising your essay:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Go through each of your paragraphs and identify your claim, evidence, and analysis. If there is no claim, then you should develop one. If you are lacking a quote from the text or an anecdote from your own experience, then you should add one. If there is no analysis of your evidence, and how it relates back to your claim, work on expanding and explaining your ideas. Remember, each paragraph should have only one claim developed.</li>
        <li>When you cite from the text, you should follow it with the author’s name and page number in parentheses like this (Anzaldúa 12).</li>
        <li>Expand even further on your personal experiences and connect them back to Anzaldúa’s essay with quotes from the text. Remember, your essay needs to be 3 pages minimum. You have a lot of room to expand on both your analysis of Anzaldúa’s text, and your own experiences.</li>
        <li>I have circled in your essay ideas or concepts you briefly mention but do not explain. Explaining them will help further the ideas of your essay.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Keep up the good work!</p>
