  <h1>Essay 1: Literacy Autobiography **FINAL DRAFT**</h1>

    <div class="content">
      Language is a powerful force in shaping who we are and how we connect to our culture. Gloria Anzaldúa talks about this in her essay How to Tame a Wild Tongue. She explains how language, identity, and self-expression are linked, especially for someone like her who belongs to the Chicano community. Language is not just a way to communicate for Anzaldúa it is a key part of her identity. My experiences as a non-native English speaker also show how language influences how I see myself and my place in the world.

      Anzaldúa describes how hard it is to use different languages, like English and Chicano Spanish, at the same time. She says, “Until I am free to write bilingually and to switch codes without having always to translate... my tongue will be illegitimate.” This quote shows her frustration with society's pressure to speak one “correct” language. Chicano Spanish, a mix of English and Spanish, was criticized by English speakers as being wrong and by Spanish speakers as not being pure enough. Because of this, she often felt like she didn’t fully belong in either world. However, Anzaldúa chose to embrace her language and called it a “living language.” This means her language is alive, real, and constantly changing, just like her culture.

      I understand how Anzaldúa feels because I have faced similar challenges. When I moved to the United States, I had to learn to speak English in a way that people would accept. At school, I worked hard to speak proper English so I wouldn’t stand out, but it was difficult and made me feel different. At home, I could relax and speak my native language with my family, which brought me comfort and helped me stay connected to my roots. Switching between these two worlds made me feel like I didn’t completely belong to either one, just like Anzaldúa felt about her own experiences.

      Anzaldúa also writes about being punished in school for speaking Spanish, even when she was trying to explain something simple, like how to say her name correctly. This shows how language discrimination can make someone feel invisible or unimportant. I have gone through moments like this too. For example, people have told me to “speak only English” in public places. Even though they didn’t mean to hurt me, it made me feel like my native language wasn’t welcome, which was upsetting because it’s such an important part of who I am.

      Even with these difficulties, Anzaldúa’s story shows that we can find strength in our differences. She says, “I will no longer be made to feel ashamed of existing. I will have my voice... I will overcome the tradition of silence.” This inspires me to take pride in my own language and cultural background. Her words remind me that being part of two cultures is something to celebrate, not something to be ashamed of.

      Over time, I’ve started to see bilingualism as a strength. My native language helps me stay connected to my culture and family. It reminds me of my heritage and gives me a sense of belonging. On the other hand, English helps me succeed in school and communicate with people from different backgrounds. Like Anzaldúa, I have realized that moving between languages is not a weakness but a reflection of who I am. It allows me to express myself fully and shows the rich mix of my identity.

      Sometimes, when I can’t use my native language in certain situations, I feel a bit disconnected from my culture. But I’ve learned to use these moments to share my heritage with others. For example, when I accidentally mix languages in a conversation, it feels like a natural way of showing who I am. Anzaldúa’s essay reminds me that blending languages isn’t a mistake—it’s a sign of creativity and adaptability.

      Anzaldúa also shows how language can be a way to stand up against unfair rules. By using Chicano Spanish in her writing, she proves that it’s an important and valid way of speaking, even if it doesn’t follow traditional grammar. This reminds me that speaking my native language in public or sharing it with others is a way to stay connected to my roots and to proudly show who I am. Language becomes more than just a tool for talking it’s a way to share our stories and keep our cultures alive.

      In conclusion, Anzaldúa’s essay is a powerful reminder of how important language is to identity. She encourages us to be proud of our differences instead of hiding them. Her story inspires people like me to celebrate our languages and cultures, even if it feels challenging at times. While switching between languages can be difficult, it also gives us a unique perspective and helps us connect with different parts of who we are. Anzaldúa’s idea of a “wild tongue” teaches us to embrace the beauty of being multilingual and to take pride in how our languages shape us.

            <td>You start giving me some context about how language has impacted some experiences in your life; thank you for revising this based on my previous feedback. What I was really looking for, and what the prompt called for, was a critical reflection on how language has influenced your identity. That is, how do the languages you use impact how you see yourself as a person? When you aren’t able to speak your language, do you feel, like Anzaldúa does, that you aren’t connected to your culture? Do you feel as able to express yourself and your identity and your culture in English as you do your native language? Have you been told not to speak your language, and if so, how did that make you feel? These are just some questions which can guide deeper thinking into how language influences your identity.</td>
