  <h1>Essay 3: Research Paper **ROUGH DRAFT #1**</h1>

    <div class="content">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Teaching kids in their native language is a big topic in education, especially for children who grow up speaking one language at home and another at school. Two articles, <em>Lost in Translation</em> by Maya Alkateb-Chamis and <em>The Evolution of Literacy Education</em>, focus on how language affects learning. <em>Lost in Translation</em> explains that kids who don’t learn in their home language often struggle with reading and writing. It suggests that using their first language in school can help them do better. The second article talks about how teaching reading and writing has changed over time, from ancient methods to today’s phonics-based systems. Both articles show how important language is in helping children succeed, especially kids from multilingual backgrounds, like Asian children living in the U.S.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some experts think teaching kids in their home language gives them a strong start in learning. Others believe it’s better to focus on the school language, like English, to help them fit in faster. This leads to an important question: How can teaching in a child’s first language improve their reading, writing, and school performance? This essay will look at this question using research and theories like Jim Cummins’ Threshold Hypothesis, while also considering different opinions on the issue.
      </p>
      <h2>Annotated Bibliography</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>

          Summary: This article explains how teaching reading and writing has changed over time. It talks about ancient writing systems and how they led to modern teaching methods, like phonics.
          <br>
          Credibility: While the article is helpful for background information, it doesn’t name a specific author, so it’s less detailed and reliable than other sources.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cummins, Jim. <em>Language, Power, and Pedagogy</em>. 2000.</strong>
          <br>
          Summary: This book explains the Threshold Hypothesis, which says that being good in your first language makes it easier to learn a second language. It also shows how skills in one language can help in another.
          <br>
          Credibility: Jim Cummins is a well-known expert in bilingual education, and this book is often used in research. It’s a very trustworthy source.

          <strong>Thomas, Wayne, and Virginia Collier. <em>School Effectiveness for Language Minority Students</em>. 1997.</strong>
          <br>
          Summary: This study shows that kids who learn in both their home language and the school language do better in school over time. Bilingual programs help them succeed more than programs that only teach in English.
          <br>
          Credibility: This study is a key piece of research in bilingual education and is widely respected, making it a strong source for the essay.

          <strong>Porter, Rosalie. <em>The Case Against Bilingual Education</em>. 1998.</strong>
          <br>
          Summary: Porter argues that kids learn English faster in immersion programs, where only English is used. She believes this helps kids adapt to school and society more quickly.
          <br>
          Credibility: Although the author’s ideas are debated, the book offers a different point of view that helps balance the essay. It’s useful for understanding the other side of the argument.

      <h2>Feedback</h2>
      <p>Good work, Shabbir. This is going to be an interesting essay. I would suggest that, when you reference a source such as <em>"Lost in Translation"</em> or <em>"The Evolution of Literacy Education"</em>, that you always remember to include the title in quotations.</p>
