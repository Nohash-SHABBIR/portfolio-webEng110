  <h1>Essay 2: Lens Analysis ***ROUGH DRAFT***</h1>
  <div class="container">
    <div class="content">
      In her essay "Sponsors of Literacy," Deborah Brandt talks about how different people and organizations affect how we learn to read and write. She believes that literacy is not just about skills but also about how culture and relationships shape our experiences. This idea connects well with Amy Tan’s essay "Mother Tongue," where she shares her struggles with language and identity. My own experience as a non-English speaker learning digital skills shows how different sponsors influence our learning journeys. By looking at Tan’s story and my experience, we can see that while some sponsors help us grow, others can make learning harder. This idea expands Brandt's view of sponsorship by showing how we can take control of our learning.

      In "Mother Tongue," Amy Tan helps us understand how sponsors affect our literacy. She shares her experiences with language and how her mother’s "limited English" influenced how she saw herself and her writing. Tan writes, “I felt that I had to write in a different way from the way I was thinking.” This shows the struggle she faces when dealing with her mother’s language. Tan’s story highlights how society’s views on language can help or hurt our confidence in communicating. Her mother represents a type of support that, despite its challenges, encourages Tan to explore her identity through her writing.

      As a non-English speaker, I faced similar challenges when I moved to an English-speaking country. I struggled not only to learn the language but also to understand the culture and daily life, which were very different from what I knew in my home country. My parents were supportive, but they didn’t speak English well and didn’t understand American culture either. This made it hard for me to navigate my new environment. It wasn’t until I enrolled in a college that I found helpful sponsors—my teacher and classmates—who guided me and helped me gain confidence. However, like Tan, I also faced doubts from some peers who thought I wouldn’t be good at it because I was still learning English. This shows how sponsors can significantly influence our learning experiences, as Brandt points out.

      In conclusion, comparing Amy Tan’s experiences with my journey as a non-English speaker highlights the important connection between literacy and sponsorship that Deborah Brandt discusses. Both stories show how sponsors play a crucial role in shaping how we learn, revealing both the benefits and challenges of sponsorship.

      <h2>Feedback</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Your analysis of Tan’s sponsors could use more development. For example, you mention Tan’s mother as a “support,” but don’t explicitly call her a sponsor. Think of who else in Tan’s essays sponsored—or didn’t sponsor—her English language development and skills. Do you find any similarities between her sponsors and yours?</li>
        <li>Go into more detail about your own sponsors. How have your friends and teachers sponsored you? What have they done specifically to sponsor your literacy in the United States? And what literacy did they sponsor; English literacy, or your “digital literacy” as you mention in your introduction?</li>
        <li>In your final draft, you must interact more with Brandt’s essay. That means quoting directly from it to support your thesis that Brandt’s view of sponsorship has been expanded by Tan’s experiences and your experiences. What theories of sponsorship, precisely, are you expanding on? You must explicitly mention them in your essay.</li>
        <li>Take some time and refine your thesis statement based on our previous class discussions.</li>
        <li>Remember that this draft must be formatted in MLA format, with a header, title, page numbers, in-text parenthetical citations with page numbers, and a works cited page.</li>
