  <h2>This homework assignment has to be my favorite piece of writing from the whole semester. Why? Because I wrote barely anything and still got full credit Honestly, the feedback I received was longer than the actual assignmentâ€”talk about efficiency</h2>
  <h3>Overall Feedback
    Interesting early idea here, Shabbir. So would your essay further develop the role of individual or self-literacy sponsorship? Do your experiences or the experiences of any of the authors we've read support that? Also, even when an individual might decide to sponsor themselves, there are still outside sponsors that play a not insignificant role. For example, if I want to teach myself a language like Spanish, what resources do I access? Do I learn through paid a community program? Do I learn through mass media like TV or movies? Do I learn by speaking to friends? I'm taking the steps myself to acquire that literacy, but there are still external forces. </h3>
