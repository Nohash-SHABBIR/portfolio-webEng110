  <h1>Essay 2: Lens Analysis **FINAL DRAFT**</h1>
  <div class="container">
    <div class="content">
      In "Sponsors of Literacy," Deborah Brandt discusses how various individuals and organizations influence our literacy development. Brandt suggests that literacy extends beyond skills; it’s shaped by culture, relationships, and the resources available to us. This concept closely relates to Amy Tan’s essay "Mother Tongue," where she reflects on her experiences with language and identity in light of her mother’s "limited English." Examining Tan’s story alongside my own experiences as a non-native English speaker learning digital skills, it becomes clear that sponsors impact our learning in both supportive and challenging ways. This analysis extends Brandt’s ideas by showing that, while some sponsors help us grow, others create obstacles—yet we can still navigate our learning paths with agency.

      Tan’s "Mother Tongue" illustrates how sponsors influence literacy in unique ways. She describes her relationship with language, particularly the impact her mother’s limited English had on her sense of self and approach to writing. While her mother might not be a typical sponsor, she indirectly influenced Tan’s literacy by encouraging her to engage deeply with language despite its difficulties. Tan shares, “I felt that I had to write in a different way from the way I was thinking” (Tan), illustrating the tension she felt between her family’s language and societal expectations. Teachers and cultural standards also shaped Tan’s English development, at times making her feel inadequate even as her abilities grew. This highlights how societal views on language can support or undermine confidence, influencing our approach to communication.

      In my case, I faced similar hurdles learning English and adapting to a new culture after moving to an English-speaking country. The language barrier was just one challenge; understanding cultural norms and daily life was equally demanding. My parents, like Tan’s mother, were supportive but couldn’t guide me fully due to their own language and cultural limitations. However, in college, I found direct sponsors, such as teachers and classmates, who helped me build confidence and provided resources for learning. For example, some of my college teachers encouraged me to practice writing and gave valuable feedback, supporting both my English literacy and digital skills. Friends I made in computer classes also introduced me to tools that helped me develop my technical skills. However, as with Tan, I occasionally faced skepticism from peers who questioned my abilities due to my language background. This experience reflects Brandt’s idea of sponsorship, where certain figures control or influence access to literacy. Brandt explains that “sponsors…lend their resources or credibility. But can also regulate the literacy of others” (Brandt 167). My sponsors empowered me to grow, while others unintentionally hindered my progress, highlighting the mixed impact sponsors have on learning.

      In conclusion, by comparing Tan’s experiences to my journey as a non-native English speaker, we see how Brandt’s concepts on literacy sponsorship are evident in real life. Both Tan and I show how sponsors shape our literacy journeys, revealing both the positive and negative sides of this influence. Understanding the varied impact of sponsors, from family to educators to peers, expands Brandt’s theory to show how people can both support and challenge our growth in different types of literacy.

      <h2>Feedback</h2>
      <p>The feedback I received on my essay 2 rough draft includes the following suggestions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your analysis of Tan’s sponsors could use more development. For example, you mention Tan’s mother as a “support,” but don’t explicitly call her a sponsor. Think of who else in Tan’s essays sponsored—or didn’t sponsor—her English language development and skills. Do you find any similarities between her sponsors and yours?</li>
        <li>Go into more detail about your own sponsors. How have your friends and teachers sponsored you? What have they done specifically to sponsor your literacy in the United States? And what literacy did they sponsor; English literacy, or your “digital literacy” as you mention in your introduction?</li>
        <li>In your final draft, you must interact more with Brandt’s essay. That means quoting directly from it to support your thesis that Brandt’s view of sponsorship has been expanded by Tan’s experiences and your experiences. What theories of sponsorship, precisely, are you expanding on? You must explicitly mention them in your essay.</li>
        <li>Take some time and refine your thesis statement based on our previous class discussions.</li>
        <li>Remember that this draft must be formatted in MLA format, with a header, title, page numbers, in-text parenthetical citations with page numbers, and a works cited page.</li>

            <td>I had expected to see more analysis of Tan’s experience and direct quotations from the text. You mention briefly “teachers and cultural standards” but don’t identify teachers with sponsors and you don’t address what type of literacy was being withheld when you mention cultural standards. Again, specificity shows me and a reader that you understand the source materials and lends strength and credibility to your argument.</td>

            <td>I would like to have seen more work done with Brandt’s essay. Remember one of the homework assignments due before this essay, which asked you to identify 5 theories or ideas from Brandt’s essay? The goal was that you would use each of these ideas, or “lenses” to analyze a specific instance in your experience and Tan’s experience. Naming each of the lenses would have gone a long way to adding specificity to your essay and would have strengthened your argument. It also would have naturally led to including more textual evidence in the form of quotations and paraphrases which are essential to an argument.</td>

            <td>Your second body-paragraph has too many sub-topics. Before you submit an assignment, it would be helpful to return to your essay and read each paragraph carefully, asking yourself: am I addressing more than one idea in this paragraph? Even though sub-topics are related to a larger main topic, they are still separate ideas and should be given their own space to be developed.</td>

Good attempt at including parenthetical citations, but there were not enough and some of them lacked page numbers. Remember, a page number allows a reader of your essay to reference in the text where the text you cite comes from. If I was unfamiliar with “Mother Tongue,” from your essay I would be unable to tell where your quote from Tan’s essay came from.</td>
